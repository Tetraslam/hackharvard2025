## üéÆ BALANCE PHILOSOPHY

This move system creates a **rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock** style meta where:

1. **Every move has counters** - No single strategy dominates
2. **Risk vs Reward** - High damage moves are slow/telegraphed
3. **Skill Expression** - Complex gestures reward practice
4. **Mind Games** - Prediction and reads are crucial
5. **Thematic Consistency** - Each move feels like a real spell
6. **Streamer Moments** - High drama and comedy potential

The system encourages **aggressive play** while providing **defensive options**, creating a dynamic meta that evolves as players learn the interactions.
